## Professional Summary

I build and scale product launch operations for complex, multi-surface products at enterprise scale. At Canon EMEA, I established the operating system for design system launches across 57 sites in 27 languages—owning the launch calendar, creating repeatable processes, coordinating cross-functional teams (Security, Legal, IT, Marketing), and delivering measurable efficiency gains. Pioneer in AI-native operations, using Claude Code and AI-powered automation to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort by 60%, and accelerate delivery. I excel at creating structure from ambiguity, turning complex launch coordination into scalable systems that enable teams to ship with confidence.
